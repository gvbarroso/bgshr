# Examples

Here we show how `bgshr` can be used to predict landscapes of diversity 
reduction due to background selection (quantified as B-values) and diversity.
Data for chromosome 22 can be found in [data/](data/) and an equilibrium 
lookup table generated by `moments++` is located at 
[lookup_tables/lookup_tbl_equilibrium.csv](lookup_tables/lookup_tbl_equilibrium.csv).
